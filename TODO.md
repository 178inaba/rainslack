## utc -> jst
time of docker is so UTC, I add the process of converting the UTC to JST.

## Image stacking order
It is corrected to come on because the mask image is not coming on.

## Duplicate upload
Do not upload the same image

## image delete
Since the capacity limit of the slack is 5GB, do the deletion of the image in some logic.
